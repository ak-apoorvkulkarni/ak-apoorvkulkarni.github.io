# GitHub Pages

The site is served from the **main** branch at **https://ak-apoorvkulkarni.github.io**.

For a **username.github.io** repo, GitHub Pages uses **main** by default, so no Settings change is needed. The site should be live within 1–2 minutes after deploy.

To update the site, push your code to the **source** branch (see DEPLOY.md).
