# GitHub Pages – One-time setup

Your site is built and deployed to the **gh-pages** branch. For it to appear at **https://ak-apoorvkulkarni.github.io** you must set the source once:

1. Open: **https://github.com/ak-apoorvkulkarni/ak-apoorvkulkarni.github.io**
2. Go to **Settings** → **Pages** (left sidebar).
3. Under **Build and deployment** → **Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Under **Branch**: select **gh-pages** and **/ (root)**.
5. Click **Save**.

After 1–2 minutes the site will be live. Every push to `main` will rebuild and update the site automatically.
