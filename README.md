## üéØ About Me

I am a graduate student at the **Karlsruhe Institute of Technology** with a solid background in embedded systems, PCB design, and applied electronics. My work focuses on building practical, hardware-driven solutions that integrate both hardware and software effectively.

Currently, I am developing an ultra-low voltage sensing and signal processing unit for thermoelectric sensors. This includes designing precision analog front-end circuits, amplification and filtering systems, and digital readout interfaces optimized for microvolt-level signals. The project aims to enable reliable, low-power sensing for applications such as temperature and energy monitoring.
