# Apoorv Kulkarni – Portfolio

## About Me
Electrical Engineering graduate from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology with a solid background in embedded systems, PCB design, and applied electronics. My work focuses on building practical, hardware driven solutions that integrate both hardware and software effectively.

Currently, I work as a Junior Drone Engineer at Dronivo GmbH, where I contribute to drone development and avionics. I also have hands on experience in precision analog design, including ultra low voltage sensing and signal conditioning for thermoelectric sensors, and in developing reliable, low power systems for temperature and energy monitoring.
